    Coding is the process of using a programming language to get a computer to behave how you want it to. Every line of code tells the computer to do something, and a document full of lines of code is called a script. Each script is designed to carry out a job. 
    This job might be to take an image and change its size

    In computers, coding is done so that the system can understand what is expected for it to be done. The benefits of learning coding are many and the most beneficial ones. 
    Coding helps you build applications, put them over servers and use so that multiple users can use it and get the benefits.

    Coding makes it possible for us to create computer software, games, apps and websites. Coders, or programmers, are people who write the programmes behind everything we see and do on a computer. When children learn to code, 
    it helps them to develop essential skills such as problem solving, logic and critical thinking
